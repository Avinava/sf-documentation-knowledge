# AnalyticsSettings

# AnalyticsSettings

Represents Analytics settings in Salesforce. CRM Analytics lets you explore all your data quickly and easily by providing AI-powered advanced Analytics right inside Salesforce. Manage your datasets, query data with Salesforce Analytics Query Language (SAQL), and customize dashboards. You can use these settings to configure which Analytics features are available to users in your organization.

This type extends the [Metadata](atlas.en-us.api_meta.meta/api_meta/metadata.htm "The base class for all metadata types. You can’t edit this object. A component is an instance of a metadata type.") metadata type and inherits its fullName field.

## File Suffix and Directory Location

AnalyticsSettings values are stored in the Analytics.settings file in the settings folder. The .settings files are different from other named components because there’s only one settings file for each settings component.

## Version

AnalyticsSettings components are available in API version 46.0 and later.

## Special Access Rules

The AnalyticsSettings metadata type is accessible in all organizations. The fields that pertain to Reports and Dashboards are available in all organizations, but fields that pertain to CRM Analytics are only available in organizations with CRM Analytics enabled.

## Declarative Metadata Sample Definition

## Example Package Manifest

## Wildcard Support in the Manifest File

The wildcard character \* (asterisk) in the package.xml manifest file doesn’t apply to metadata types for feature settings. The wildcard applies only when retrieving all settings, not for an individual setting. For details, see [Settings](atlas.en-us.api_meta.meta/api_meta/meta_settings.htm "Represents the organization settings related to a feature. For example, your password policies, session settings and network access controls are all available in the SecuritySettings component type."). For information about using the manifest file, see [Deploying and Retrieving Metadata with the Zip File](atlas.en-us.api_meta.meta/api_meta/file_based_zip_file.htm "The deploy() and retrieve() calls are used to deploy and retrieve a .zip file. Within the .zip file is a project manifest (package.xml) that lists what to retrieve or deploy, and one or more XML components that are organized into folders.").
