# StandardObjectNameHistory

StandardObjectNameHistory is the model for all history objects associated with standard objects. These objects represent the history of changes to the values in the fields of a standard object.

The object name is variable and uses StandardObjectNameHistory syntax. For example, AccountHistory represents the history of changes to the values of an account record’s fields. We list the available associated history objects at the end of this topic. For specific version information, see the documentation for the standard object.
