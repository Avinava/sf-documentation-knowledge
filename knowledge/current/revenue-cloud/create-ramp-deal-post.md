# Create Ramp Deal (POST)

Create a ramp deal for a customer on a product. Sales reps can use ramp deals to provide yearly deals to a customer, resulting in long-term revenue and customer relationship. A customer can create, update, or view multiple segments of periods for their subscription term with different attributes for each segment.

This API request creates segments based on the specified input properties such as term, segment type, and trial details. The API response includes the context ID and the updated context object for the sales transaction. You must call the Place Sales Transaction API by specifying this context ID to apply the ramp deal updates.
