# Automate Refund Action

Initiate refund orchestration for a credit memo generated from a subscription cancellation or negative amendment.

When you cancel a subscription or make a change that lowers the price (a negative amendment), a credit memo is generated. A credit memo is a record that represents the amount to be returned. Use this action to process the refund for that credit memo.

During an invoice batch run, Revenue Cloud Billing uses these two org preferences to run the refund orchestration.

-   Conversion of negative invoice lines to credit memo and credit memo lines—When turned on, this org preference creates a credit memo from the negative invoice lines of a cancellation or a negative amendment, and then emits a credit memo event.
-   Issue refunds and settle balances — Listens to the credit memo event and starts the refund orchestration for the converted credit memo.

Turn off these org preferences to call this action directly and choose which credit memo receives a refund.

In both modes, the orchestration runs these steps in order.

-   Remove payments from the original invoice. Partial removal isn’t supported, so each selected payment is removed in full. For example, if an invoice has two payments P1 ($20) and P2 ($15) and the refund amount is $30, the orchestration removes both P1 and P2 in full for a total of $35.
-   Apply back any extra amount to the invoice. In the example above, $35 was removed but only $30 is needed for the refund. The orchestration applies the extra $5 from P2 back to the original invoice.
-   Apply the credit memo to the original invoice to record the credit.
-   Send a refund request to the payment gateway. The payment gateway is the service that processes the customer's payment method. For example, a credit card processor. In the example above, the orchestration sends two separate refund requests, one for P1 ($20) and one for P2 ($10, the portion not applied back).
-   Record each refund against its original payment.

The orchestration selects the fewest payments to unapply so that the total unapplied amount is at least equal to the refund amount.

This action is available in API version 67.0 and later.
