# Loyalty Program Process

Run a loyalty process created from a loyalty program process template.

Out-of-the-box loyalty program process templates come with a default set of process parameters. You can configure new parameters or remove the default ones by simply cloning a template and running the configured parameters as a customized loyalty process using the loyalty program process API. For example, when using the CreditPointsToMembers process template to credit points to a loyalty member, you can configure the currency value so that the credited points can be redeemed in the currency you’ve specified.

The request and response parameters for the loyalty program process API vary depending on the input and output parameters configured for a loyalty program process in a Salesforce org.
