## Usage

-   This Apex example shows how to add an attachment to a Lead using API version 36.0 and later. First, post a feed item.

    ```

    ```

    Then insert the attachment.

    ```

    ```

-   You can create only one link attachment (FeedAttachment of type Link) per feed item.
-   If the feed item type is one of the following, you can add content or link feed attachments to a FeedItem.
    -   AdvancedTextPost
    -   TextPost
    -   ContentPost
    -   LinkPost
    -   QuestionPost
-   When a FeedAttachment is added or removed from a feed item, Salesforce updates the type of the feed item to its most appropriate value, as follows.
    -   If all content feed attachments are removed from a feed item of type ContentPost, the type of this feed item is updated to TextPost.
    -   Conversely, if a content feed attachment is added to a feed item of type TextPost, the type of this feed item is updated to ContentPost.
    -   If all link feed attachments are removed from a feed item of type LinkPost, the type of this feed item is updated to TextPost.
    -   Conversely, if a link feed attachment is added to a feed item of type TextPost, the type of this feed item is updated to LinkPost.
    -   The type of all other feed items, such as QuestionPost or AdvancedTextPost feed items, doesn’t change when any feed attachments are added or removed.
    -   If a content feed attachment is added to a feed item of type LinkPost, the feed item type is updated to ContentPost.
    -   If all content attachments are removed from a feed item of type ContentPost, but there's also a link attachment, the feed item type is updated to LinkPost.
-   Users without administrator privileges can’t retrieve a FeedAttachment by its ID in a SOQL query. They can retrieve attachments by specifying the associated FeedEntityId, as follows:

    ```

    ```

-   Alternatively, retrieve attachments by using a SOQL query on FeedItem with a subquery on the FeedAttachments child relationship, as follows.

    ```

    ```

-   FeedAttachment is not a triggerable object. You can access feed attachments in FeedItem *update* triggers by retrieving them through a SOQL query. For a trigger example, and to learn about trigger considerations for FeedAttachment, see [Triggers for Chatter Objects](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.260.0.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_triggers_fields_not_updated_chatter.htm) in the Apex Developer Guide.

## Code Examples

```
//create and insert post
FeedItem post = new FeedItem();
post.Body = 'HelloThere';

```

```
//create and associate a content attachment to the post
FeedAttachment feedAttachment = new FeedAttachment();
feedAttachment.FeedEntityId = post.Id;
