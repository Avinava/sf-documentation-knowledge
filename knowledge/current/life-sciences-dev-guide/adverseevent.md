Here’s how the fields defined by FHIR for [adverseEvent](https://build.fhir.org/adverseevent-definitions.html) map to the fields in Salesforce.

| Adverse​Event Resource | Salesforce Field | Type | Salesforce Cardinality | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| status | Adverse​Event​Entry.​Status | Dynamic Enum | 1.1 | While FHIR defines adverse​Event​Entry​.status as a code set, the Salesforce implementation of Adverse​Event​Entry​.Status is text. |
| actuality | Adverse​Event​Entry​.​Type | Dynamic Enum | 1.1 | While FHIR defines adverse​Event​Entry​.actuality as a code set, the Salesforce implementation of Adverse​Event​Entry​.type is dynamic enum. |
| category | Adverse​Event​​Entry​.Category | Picklist (Multi-Select) | 0.M | While FHIR defines adverse​Event​Entry​.category as a code set bundle, the Salesforce implementation of Adverse​Event​Entry​.Category is picklist (Multi-Select). |
| code | Adverse​Event​Entry​.Event​Code | Look​up: Code Set, Code Set Bundle | 0.1 | While FHIR defines adverse​Event​Entry​.event​Code as a code set bundle, the Salesforce implementation of Adverse​Event​Entry​.EventCode is a lookup. |

| cause | Adverse​Event​Entry.​Cause​Start​Date​Time | Date/Time | 0.1 | Since Salesforce doesn’t natively support the period data type, adverse​Event​.​cause is flattened into a set of cause start date time and cause end date time fields. |
| Adverse​Event​Entry​.Cause​End​Date​Time | Date​/Time | 0.1 |
| effect | Adverse​Event​Entry​.Event​Start​Date​Time | Date/Time | 0.1 | Since Salesforce doesn’t natively support the period data type, adverse​Event​.​effect is flattened into a set of event start date time and event end date time fields. |
